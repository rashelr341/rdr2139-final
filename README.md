Final Project

In this assignment, we created a backend using Flask to link several webpages.

The website loads the index.html page. When the user clicks the white button, 
the page scrolls to the next div block where some personal details are written.
This button is used for the other webpages too. There is also a navigation bar 
at the top of the screen that the user can use to go to other webpages. These 
other webpages include a list of classes I've taken this semester (class.html)
as well as a small gallery of photos of my cat (fun.html).

Note:
* The navigation bar is on every webpage. 
* The background image is fixed on every page but is partly hidden as the 
  user scrolls to the next div block.
* Credit for parallax scrolling effect and overlay effects on hover can be 
  attributed to the following sites:
